sh scripts for better experience

* Create folder 'clients' in folder with scripts
* `sh addclient.sh` - For add new client with name (save config in folder)
* `sh statistic.sh` - Show traffic statistic for filenames in client folder (Statistics reset while every time when run addclient.sh, sorry, it's wireguard problem)
